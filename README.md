# JavaFX Dungeon Crawler Prototype
Originally a school project aimed at understanding how to make a grid based game using JavaFX. This game was written using Eclipse IDE and deploys complex algorithms such as A* pathfinding and procedural level generation to enhance gameplay and replayability. Based off of Miziziziz's "How to Make A Roguelike in A Day" video, which utilized Godot engine, as a challenge and learning experience, I cloned the game from the ground up entirely using Java and JavaFX to learn and understand more abstract concepts. I'm leaving this project open source and provide documentation from the early prototype phases.
# Eclipse Project
When importing, select the "MicroRoguelike" folder, JavaFX is included but I have not tested how seemless the import process is.
